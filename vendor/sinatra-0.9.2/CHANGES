= 0.9.2 / unreleased

 * This version is compatible with Rack 1.0. [Rein Henrichs]

 * The development-mode unhandled exception / error page has been
   greatly enhanced, functionally and aesthetically. The error
   page is used when the :show_exceptions option is enabled and an
   exception propagates outside of a route handler or before filter.
   [Simon Rozet / Matte Noble / Ryan Tomayko]

 * Backtraces that move through templates now include filenames and
   line numbers where possible. [#51 / S. Brent Faulkner]

 * All templates now have an app-level option for setting default
   template options (:haml, :sass, :erb, :builder). The app-level
   option value must be a Hash if set and is merged with the
   template options specified to the render method (Base#haml,
   Base#erb, Base#builder). [S. Brent Faulkner, Ryan Tomayko]

 * The method signature for all template rendering methods has
   been unified: "def engine(template, options={}, locals={})".
   The options Hash now takes the generic :views, :layout, and
   :locals options but also any template-specific options. The
   generic options are removed before calling the template specific
   render method. Locals may be specified using either the
   :locals key in the options hash or a second Hash option to the
   rendering method. [#191 / Ryan Tomayko]

 * The receiver is now passed to "configure" blocks. This
   allows for the following idiom in top-level apps:
   configure { |app| set :foo, app.root + '/foo' }
   [TJ Holowaychuck / Ryan Tomayko]

 * The "sinatra/test" lib is deprecated and will be removed in
   Sinatra 1.0. This includes the Sinatra::Test module and
   Sinatra::TestHarness class in addition to all the framework
   test helpers that were deprecated in 0.9.1. The Rack::Test
   lib should be used instead: http://gitrdoc.com/brynary/rack-test
   [#176 / Simon Rozet]

 * Development mode source file reloading has been removed. The
   "shotgun" (http://rtomayko.github.com/shotgun/) program can be
   used to achieve the same basic functionality in most situations.
   Passenger users should use the "tmp/always_restart.txt"
   file (http://tinyurl.com/c67o4h). [#166 / Ryan Tomayko]

 * Auto-requiring template libs in the erb, builder, haml, and
   sass methods is deprecated due to thread-safety issues. You must
   require the template libs explicitly in your app file. [Simon Rozet]

 * A new Sinatra::Base#route_missing method was added. route_missing
   is sent when no route matches the request or all route handlers
   pass.  The default implementation forwards the request to the
   downstream app when running as middleware (i.e., "@app" is
   non-nil), or raises a NotFound exception when no downstream app
   is defined. Subclasses can override this method to perform custom
   route miss logic. [Jon Crosby]

 * A new Sinatra::Base#route_eval method was added. The method
   yields to the block and throws :halt with the result. Subclasses
   can override this method to tap into the route execution logic.
   [TJ Holowaychuck]

 * Fix the "-x" (enable request mutex / locking) command line
   argument. Passing -x now properly sets the :lock option.
   [S. Brent Faulkner, Ryan Tomayko]

 * Fix writer ("foo=") and predicate ("foo?") methods in extension
   modules not being added to the registering class.
   [#172 / Pat Nakajima]

 * Fix in-file templates when running alongside activesupport and
   fatal errors when requiring activesupport before sinatra
   [#178 / Brian Candler]

 * Fix various issues running on Google AppEngine.
   [Samuel Goebert, Simon Rozet]

 * Fix in-file templates __END__ detection when __END__ exists with
   other stuff on a line [Yoji Shidara]

= 0.9.1.1 / 2009-03-09

 * Fix directory traversal vulnerability in default static files
   route. See [#177] for more info.

= 0.9.1 / 2009-03-01

 * Sinatra now runs under Ruby 1.9.1 [#61]

 * Route patterns (splats, :named, or Regexp captures) are now
   passed as arguments to the block. [#140]

 * The "helpers" method now takes a variable number of modules
   along with the normal block syntax. [#133]

 * New request-level #forward method for middleware components: passes
   the env to the downstream app and merges the response status, headers,
   and body into the current context. [#126]

 * Requests are now automatically forwarded to the downstream app when
   running as middleware and no matching route is found or all routes
   pass.

 * New simple API for extensions/plugins to add DSL-level and
   request-level methods. Use Sinatra.register(mixin) to extend
   the DSL with all public methods defined in the mixin module;
   use Sinatra.helpers(mixin) to make all public methods defined
   in the mixin module available at the request level. [#138]
   See http://www.sinatrarb.com/extensions.html for details.

 * Named parameters in routes now capture the "." character. This makes
   routes like "/:path/:filename" match against requests like
   "/foo/bar.txt"; in this case, "params[:filename]" is "bar.txt".
   Previously, the route would not match at all.

 * Added request-level "redirect back" to redirect to the referring
   URL.

 * Added a new "clean_trace" option that causes backtraces dumped
   to rack.errors and displayed on the development error page to
   omit framework and core library backtrace lines. The option is
   enabled by default. [#77]

 * The ERB output buffer is now available to helpers via the @_out_buf
   instance variable.

 * It's now much easier to test sessions in unit tests by passing a
   ":session" option to any of the mock request methods. e.g.,
       get '/', {}, :session => { 'foo' => 'bar' }

 * The testing framework specific files ('sinatra/test/spec',
   'sinatra/test/bacon', 'sinatra/test/rspec', etc.) have been deprecated.
   See http://sinatrarb.com/testing.html for instructions on setting up
   a testing environment with these frameworks.

 * The request-level #send_data method from Sinatra 0.3.3 has been added
   for compatibility but is deprecated.

 * Fix :provides causing crash on any request when request has no
   Accept header [#139]

 * Fix that ERB templates were evaluated twice per "erb" call.

 * Fix app-level middleware not being run when the Sinatra application is
   run as middleware.

 * Fixed some issues with running under Rack's CGI handler caused by
   writing informational stuff to stdout.

 * Fixed that reloading was sometimes enabled when starting from a
   rackup file [#110]

 * Fixed that "." in route patterns erroneously matched any character
   instead of a literal ".". [#124]

= 0.9.0.4 / 2009-01-25

 * Using halt with more than 1 args causes ArgumentError [#131]
 * using halt in a before filter doesn't modify response [#127]
 * Add deprecated Sinatra::EventContext to unbreak plugins [#130]
 * Give access to GET/POST params in filters [#129]
 * Preserve non-nested params in nested params hash [#117]
 * Fix backtrace dump with Rack::Lint [#116]

= 0.9.0.3 / 2009-01-21

 * Fall back on mongrel then webrick when thin not found. [#75]
 * Use :environment instead of :env in test helpers to
   fix deprecation warnings coming from framework.
 * Make sinatra/test/rspec work again [#113]
 * Fix app_file detection on windows [#118]
 * Fix static files with Rack::Lint in pipeline [#121]

= 0.9.0.2 / 2009-01-18

 * Halting a before block should stop processing of routes [#85]
 * Fix redirect/halt in before filters [#85]

= 0.9.0 / 2009-01-18

 * Works with and requires Rack >= 0.9.1

 * Multiple Sinatra applications can now co-exist peacefully within a
   single process. The new "Sinatra::Base" class can be subclassed to
   establish a blank-slate Rack application or middleware component.
   Documentation on using these features is forth-coming; the following
   provides the basic gist: http://gist.github.com/38605

 * Parameters with subscripts are now parsed into a nested/recursive
   Hash structure. e.g., "post[title]=Hello&post[body]=World" yields
   params: {'post' => {'title' => 'Hello', 'body' => 'World'}}.

 * Regular expressions may now be used in route pattens; captures are
   available at "params[:captures]".

 * New ":provides" route condition takes an array of mime types and
   matches only when an Accept request header is present with a
   corresponding type. [cypher]

 * New request-level "pass" method; immediately exits the current block
   and passes control to the next matching route.

 * The request-level "body" method now takes a block; evaluation is
   deferred until an attempt is made to read the body. The block must
   return a String or Array.

 * New "route conditions" system for attaching rules for when a route
   matches. The :agent and :host route options now use this system.

 * New "dump_errors" option controls whether the backtrace is dumped to
   rack.errors when an exception is raised from a route. The option is
   enabled by default for top-level apps.

 * Better default "app_file", "root", "public", and "views" location
   detection; changes to "root" and "app_file" automatically cascade to
   other options that depend on them.

 * Error mappings are now split into two distinct layers: exception
   mappings and custom error pages. Exception mappings are registered
   with "error(Exception)" and are run only when the app raises an
   exception. Custom error pages are registered with "error(status_code)",
   where "status_code" is an integer, and are run any time the response
   has the status code specified. It's also possible to register an error
   page for a range of status codes: "error(500..599)".

 * In-file templates are now automatically imported from the file that
   requires 'sinatra'. The use_in_file_templates! method is still available
   for loading templates from other files.

 * Sinatra's testing support is no longer dependent on Test::Unit. Requiring
   'sinatra/test' adds the Sinatra::Test module and Sinatra::TestHarness
   class, which can be used with any test framework. The 'sinatra/test/unit',
   'sinatra/test/spec', 'sinatra/test/rspec', or 'sinatra/test/bacon' files
   can be required to setup a framework-specific testing environment. See the
   README for more information.

 * Added support for Bacon (test framework). The 'sinatra/test/bacon' file
   can be required to setup Sinatra test helpers on Bacon::Context.

 * Deprecated "set_option" and "set_options"; use "set" instead.

 * Deprecated the "env" option ("options.env"); use "environment" instead.

 * Deprecated the request level "stop" method; use "halt" instead.

 * Deprecated the request level "entity_tag" method; use "etag" instead.
   Both "entity_tag" and "etag" were previously supported.

 * Deprecated the request level "headers" method (HTTP response headers);
   use "response['Header-Name']" instead.

 * Deprecated "Sinatra.application"; use "Sinatra::Application" instead.

 * Deprecated setting Sinatra.application = nil to reset an application.
   This should no longer be necessary.

 * Deprecated "Sinatra.default_options"; use
   "Sinatra::Default.set(key, value)" instead.

 * Deprecated the "ServerError" exception. All Exceptions are now
   treated as internal server errors and result in a 500 response
   status.

 * Deprecated the "get_it", "post_it", "put_it", "delete_it", and "head_it"
   test helper methods. Use "get", "post", "put", "delete", and "head",
   respectively, instead.

 * Removed Event and EventContext classes. Applications are defined in a
   subclass of Sinatra::Base; each request is processed within an
   instance.

= 0.3.3 / 2009-01-06

 * Pin to Rack 0.4.0 (this is the last release on Rack 0.4)

 * Log unhandled exception backtraces to rack.errors.

 * Use RACK_ENV environment variable to establish Sinatra
   environment when given. Thin sets this when started with
   the -e argument.

   code instead of 404.

 * BUG: use_in_file_templates! fails with CR/LF (#45)

 * BUG: Sinatra detects the app file and root path when run under
   thin/passenger.

 * Require rack-0.4 gem; removes frozen rack dir.

 * Basic RSpec support; require 'sinatra/test/rspec' instead of
   'sinatra/test/spec' to use. [avdi]

 * before filters can modify request environment vars used for
   routing (e.g., PATH_INFO, REQUEST_METHOD, etc.) for URL rewriting
   type functionality.
