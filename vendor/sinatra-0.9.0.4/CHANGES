= 0.9.0 / 2009-01-18

 * Works with and requires Rack >= 0.9.1

 * Multiple Sinatra applications can now co-exist peacefully within a
   single process. The new "Sinatra::Base" class can be subclassed to
   establish a blank-slate Rack application or middleware component.
   Documentation on using these features is forth-coming; the following
   provides the basic gist: http://gist.github.com/38605

 * Parameters with subscripts are now parsed into a nested/recursive
   Hash structure. e.g., "post[title]=Hello&post[body]=World" yields
   params: {'post' => {'title' => 'Hello', 'body' => 'World'}}.

 * Regular expressions may now be used in route pattens; captures are
   available at "params[:captures]".

 * New ":provides" route condition takes an array of mime types and
   matches only when an Accept request header is present with a
   corresponding type. [cypher]

 * New request-level "pass" method; immediately exits the current block
   and passes control to the next matching route.

 * The request-level "body" method now takes a block; evaluation is
   deferred until an attempt is made to read the body. The block must
   return a String or Array.

 * New "route conditions" system for attaching rules for when a route
   matches. The :agent and :host route options now use this system.

 * New "dump_errors" option controls whether the backtrace is dumped to
   rack.errors when an exception is raised from a route. The option is
   enabled by default for top-level apps.

 * Better default "app_file", "root", "public", and "views" location
   detection; changes to "root" and "app_file" automatically cascade to
   other options that depend on them.

 * Error mappings are now split into two distinct layers: exception
   mappings and custom error pages. Exception mappings are registered
   with "error(Exception)" and are run only when the app raises an
   exception. Custom error pages are registered with "error(status_code)",
   where "status_code" is an integer, and are run any time the response
   has the status code specified. It's also possible to register an error
   page for a range of status codes: "error(500..599)".

 * In-file templates are now automatically imported from the file that
   requires 'sinatra'. The use_in_file_templates! method is still available
   for loading templates from other files.

 * Sinatra's testing support is no longer dependent on Test::Unit. Requiring
   'sinatra/test' adds the Sinatra::Test module and Sinatra::TestHarness
   class, which can be used with any test framework. The 'sinatra/test/unit',
   'sinatra/test/spec', 'sinatra/test/rspec', or 'sinatra/test/bacon' files
   can be required to setup a framework-specific testing environment. See the
   README for more information.

 * Added support for Bacon (test framework). The 'sinatra/test/bacon' file
   can be required to setup Sinatra test helpers on Bacon::Context.

 * Deprecated "set_option" and "set_options"; use "set" instead.

 * Deprecated the "env" option ("options.env"); use "environment" instead.

 * Deprecated the request level "stop" method; use "halt" instead.

 * Deprecated the request level "entity_tag" method; use "etag" instead.
   Both "entity_tag" and "etag" were previously supported.

 * Deprecated the request level "headers" method (HTTP response headers);
   use "response['Header-Name']" instead.

 * Deprecated "Sinatra.application"; use "Sinatra::Application" instead.

 * Deprecated setting Sinatra.application = nil to reset an application.
   This should no longer be necessary.

 * Deprecated "Sinatra.default_options"; use
   "Sinatra::Default.set(key, value)" instead.

 * Deprecated the "ServerError" exception. All Exceptions are now
   treated as internal server errors and result in a 500 response
   status.

 * Deprecated the "get_it", "post_it", "put_it", "delete_it", and "head_it"
   test helper methods. Use "get", "post", "put", "delete", and "head",
   respectively, instead.

 * Removed Event and EventContext classes. Applications are defined in a
   subclass of Sinatra::Base; each request is processed within an
   instance.

= 0.3.3 / 2009-01-06

 * Pin to Rack 0.4.0 (this is the last release on Rack 0.4)

 * Log unhandled exception backtraces to rack.errors.

   environment when given. Thin sets this when started with
   the -e argument.

 * BUG: raising Sinatra::NotFound resulted in a 500 response
   code instead of 404.

 * BUG: use_in_file_templates! fails with CR/LF (#45)

 * BUG: Sinatra detects the app file and root path when run under
   thin/passenger.

= 0.3.2

 * BUG: Static and send_file read entire file into String before
   sending. Updated to stream with 8K chunks instead.

 * Rake tasks and assets for building basic documentation website.
   See http://sinatra.rubyforge.org

 * Various minor doc fixes.

= 0.3.1

   builds: gem install username-sinatra.gem --source=http://gems.github.com/

 * Require rack-0.4 gem; removes frozen rack dir.

 * Basic RSpec support; require 'sinatra/test/rspec' instead of
   'sinatra/test/spec' to use. [avdi]

 * before filters can modify request environment vars used for
   routing (e.g., PATH_INFO, REQUEST_METHOD, etc.) for URL rewriting
   type functionality.

 * In-file templates now uses @@ instead of ## as template separator.

 * Top-level environment test predicates: development?, test?, production?

 * Top-level "set", "enable", and "disable" methods for tweaking
   app options. [rtomayko]

 * New "app_file" option - override the file to reload in development
   mode [cschneid]

 * Development error/not_found page cleanup [sr, adamwiggins]
