                   Selenium-Client gem ChangeLog
                   =============================


1.2.14 (2008-03-08)
===================

 - Fixing packaging problem
 - Removed warnings when running unit tests

1.2.13 (2008-03-05)
===================

 - Patch for incremental calls to `wait_for_text` (Thank you Rick Lee-Morlang)

 - Regular expression support in `wait_for_text` (Thank you Rick Lee-Morlang)

    click "a_locator", :wait_for => :text, :text => /Some.*ing/

 - Set read and open timeout on HTTP connection to Remote Control
  
1.2.12 (2009-02-28)
===================

 - Packaging generated driver that was left out in 1.2.11 packaging

1.2.11 (2009-02-27)
===================

 - More idiomatic hash-based constructor for the client driver:

    Selenium::Client::Driver.new \
      :host => "localhost",
      :port => 4444,
      :browser => "*firefox",
      :timeout_in_seconds => 10,
      :url => "http://localhost:3000"
    
 - Added jQuery support for wait_for_ajax
 
 - Can set default javascript framework semantics when creating the
   client driver:

   Selenium::Client::Driver.new \
     :host => "localhost",
     :port => 4444,
     :browser => "*firefox",
     :timeout_in_seconds => 10,
     :url => "http://localhost:3000",
     :javascript_framework => :jquery

 - Can override default javascript framework semantics on a specific
   API call:

   driver.click "a-button" , :wait_for => :ajax, :javascript_framework => :jquery

 - Added new wait_for semantic: `:value` and `:no_value`:

    click :wait_for => :value, :element => 'a_locator', :value => 'some value'    # will wait for the field value of 'a_locator' to be 'some value'
    click :wait_for => :no_value, :element => 'a_locator', :value => 'some value' # will wait for the field value of 'a_locator' to not be 'some value'

 - Include examples in RubyGem
 - Added visible? method
 - Wait for complete shutdown when stopping Selenium RC with
   "rake selenium:rc:stop" (Thanks Aaron Tinio for the patch)
 - Fixed integration build on Windows
 - Support locator including single quotes in wait_for_xyz methods
   (Thanks Aaron Tinio for the patch)
 - Fixed various bugs in wait_for_xyz methods
 - API tests now rely on a demo application for integration testing of
   wait_for_xyz methods


1.2.10 (2009-02-02)
===================

 - Upgraded RSpec support to 1.1.12

 - Added popup support in wait_for semantics. e.g.

    click 'my_button', :wait_for => :popup, :window => 'a window id'
 
 - Fixed :wait_for => :text and :wait_for => :no_text semantics
   Thank you Wade Catron for finding the reporting this bug!
   
   The new semantics are:
   
   If you do not provide any locator the text is searched in the entire
   body of the page. e.g.
   
    click 'my_button', :wait_for => :text, :text => "Congratulations"
     
   If you provide and element locator the text search is scoped to the 
   innerHTML of that element. e.g.

    click 'my_button', :wait_for => :text, :element => "notification_box", :text => "Preferences Saved!"
    
  *** WARNING ****
  
    In the process I had to change the signature of the wait_for_text and
    wait_for_no_text methods. Please update your code if you were using
    directly any of these 2 methods:
    
    OLD:  wait_for_text(locator, text, timeout_in_seconds=nil)	  
    NEW:  wait_for_text(text, locator=nil, timeout_in_seconds=nil)

    OLD:  wait_for_no_text(locator, text, timeout_in_seconds=nil)	  
    NEW:  wait_for_no_text(text, locator=nil, timeout_in_seconds=nil)

 - More idiomatic methods to retrieves all window ids, names and titles:
       .all_window_ids, .all_window_names, all_window_titles
 
 - RSpec Helper automatically set context when starting a new test
   (lib/selenium/rspec/spec_helper)
